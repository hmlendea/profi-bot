# About

This is a Python script that interacts with the **Profi** mobile app ecosystem. Profi is a Romanian market store chain. This bot allows users to **scan a Profi QR code** (from a store checkout) and **register the purchase** to their account ‚Äî just like the official app does ‚Äî to earn cashback.

Based on [whos-gabi/ProfiAppAPI-Exploit](https://github.com/whos-gabi/ProfiAppAPI-Exploit).
